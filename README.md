1. Total KPI Cards

Total Titles (Movies + TV Shows): 8,796

This represents the entire Netflix content dataset analyzed.

The same number (8,796) appears under both “Total Show” and “Total Type,” meaning every record in the dataset is counted once — whether a movie or a TV show.

2. Type Distribution

Movies: 6.13K titles (≈70%)

TV Shows: 2.67K titles (≈30%) Netflix’s catalog is dominated by movies, which make up two-thirds of the total content.

3. Country-Wise Distribution

The largest contributor country has 2.81K titles (≈32%).

The next two countries have 0.97K (≈11%) and 0.83K (≈9%), respectively.

Many other countries contribute smaller portions (under 5%). A few countries dominate Netflix’s content, likely including the U.S., India, and the U.K., while other nations contribute minimally.

4. Ratings Distribution

Top ratings:

TV-MA (Mature Audience) → 3.2K titles

TV-14 → 2.2K titles

TV-PG / R / PG-13 follow next with fewer titles.

Very few titles are G-rated (kids) or unrated (NR/UR). The majority of Netflix’s content is aimed at mature audiences, with limited family or kids’ programming.

5. Release Trend

The chart shows releases from 1925 to 2021.

There is very little content before 2000, followed by a sharp increase after 2010, peaking around 2020. Netflix’s content library has grown exponentially in recent years, especially with the rise of Netflix Originals and global expansion.

6. Duration / Seasons Distribution

For TV shows, most have 1 season, followed by a sharp drop for 2–3 seasons.

For movies, most have a runtime between 90–100 minutes.

Netflix prefers short to medium-length movies (around 1.5 hours).

Single-season TV shows dominate, possibly due to limited series or new originals.

Conclusion

Netflix’s catalog is movie-heavy (70%) but with a strong TV presence (30%).

The U.S. and a few key markets produce most of the content.

Mature-rated shows (TV-MA, TV-14) dominate the platform.

The content library has surged post-2010, aligning with Netflix’s global growth.

Short-format and single-season series are the most common structures.
